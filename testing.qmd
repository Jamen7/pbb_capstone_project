# Introduction

## Datasets

This project analyzes three datasets downloaded from Gapminder: *Child Mortality*, *Women's Fertility*, and *Female Employment Rate*.  
- *Child Mortality* measures the number of deaths of children under five years old per 1,000 live births.  
- *Women's Fertility* captures the total number of children a woman is expected to have if she lives through her childbearing years, based on age-specific fertility rates.  
- *Female Employment Rate* reflects the percentage of women aged 15 and older who are employed in a given year.

The goal of this project is to explore and visualize trends across these datasets using Quarto.

```{python}
child_mortality = pd.read_csv("data/child_mortality_0_5_year_olds_dying_per_1000_born.csv")
fertility_wide = pd.read_csv("data/children_per_woman_total_fertility.csv")
employ_wide = pd.read_csv("data/females_aged_15plus_employment_rate_percent.csv")
```
